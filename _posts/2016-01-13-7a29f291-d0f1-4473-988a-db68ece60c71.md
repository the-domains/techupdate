so the steel strap on the Blaze does look the part...

will it feel the part, just not sure yet.

not waterproof, so no swimming with it yet.

no GPS, but not a huge issue for me

being able to use it with smarter interval training apps, that would make this and Fitbit in general a lot more appealing
